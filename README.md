# mp3Deteriorator
A small tool I want to develop to be able to push mp3 encoding to 
its max to be able to use the effects creatively in music production

My idea is to build it iteratively. So I'm just going to start with 
a very basic file load in and convert and build a GUI from there.
Ofcourse it will not be as smooth as an actual VST and there are already
amazing PlugIns which achieve this effect, but I want this project to 
be one of the first steps I make in the direction of developing
audio tools.
